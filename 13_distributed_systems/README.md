# Distributed Systems

## Core Ideas
- Batch Processing (Hadoop, Spark).
- Stream Processing (Flink, Kafka Streams).
- Distributed Training (NCCL, MPI).
- Resource Management (YARN, Mesos).

## Resources
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)

## Practice
- Write a Spark job to count word frequencies in a large dataset.
- Set up a Flink cluster and run a streaming job.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is an RDD in Spark?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the challenges of exactly-once processing semantics.
