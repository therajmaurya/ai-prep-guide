# Python for AI/ML

## Core Ideas
- Python is the lingua franca of modern AI/ML.
- Key concepts: Decorators, Generators, Context Managers, Type Hinting.
- Performance considerations: Vectorization vs Loops, GIL.

## Resources
- [Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/)

## Practice
- Implement a custom iterator and generator.
- Write a decorator to time function execution.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- Explain the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`.
- How does memory management work in Python?

### Senior Level
- Design a plugin system using Python's dynamic features.
