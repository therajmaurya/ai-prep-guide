# NumPy Fundamentals

## Core Ideas
- N-dimensional arrays (ndarrays).
- Broadcasting rules.
- Vectorized operations for performance.
- Slicing and indexing.

## Resources
- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [From Python to NumPy](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/)

## Practice
- Implement Matrix Multiplication from scratch using only broadcasting (no `np.dot`).
- Image manipulation using NumPy arrays.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- Explain the difference between a view and a copy.
- How do you handle missing data in NumPy?

### Senior Level
- Discuss memory layout (C-order vs F-order) and its impact on performance.
