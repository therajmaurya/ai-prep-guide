# PyTorch Fundamentals

## Core Ideas
- Tensors and operations.
- Dynamic Computation Graphs (Define-by-Run).
- Autograd for automatic differentiation.
- `nn.Module` and building networks.

## Resources
- [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf)

## Practice
- Implement Linear Regression using PyTorch tensors and Autograd.
- Build a simple MLP using `nn.Sequential`.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- How to move tensors between CPU and GPU?
- What is `dataset` and `dataloader`?

### Senior Level
- Explain DistributedDataParallel (DDP) vs DataParallel (DP).
