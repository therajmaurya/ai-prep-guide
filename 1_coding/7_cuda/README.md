# CUDA & GPU Programming

## Core Ideas
- GPU Architecture (SMs, Threads, Blocks, Grids).
- Memory Hierarchy (Global, Shared, Register).
- Writing Custom Kernels.
- Profiling GPU code.

## Resources
- [CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/)
- [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/)

## Practice
- Write a custom CUDA kernel for matrix multiplication.
- Profile a PyTorch model using Nsight Systems.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- Explain the concept of warp divergence.
- What is shared memory?

### Senior Level
- Optimize a kernel to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
