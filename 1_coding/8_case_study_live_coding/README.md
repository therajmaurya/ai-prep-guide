# Live Coding Case Studies

## Core Ideas
- Translating requirements to code under time pressure.
- Debugging and testing on the fly.
- Communicating thought process.
- Handling edge cases.

## Resources
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

## Practice
- Practice implementing standard ML algorithms (KNN, K-Means, Decision Tree) from scratch.
- Solve medium/hard algorithmic problems with a focus on clean code.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- Implement a function to compute IoU (Intersection over Union).

### Senior Level
- Implement a thread-safe data structure.
