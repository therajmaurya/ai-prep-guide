# Other Languages

## Core Ideas
- Role of C++ in high-performance ML (TensorFlow/PyTorch backends).
- Java/Scala in Big Data (Spark).
- Rust for safety and performance.

## Resources
- [PyBind11 Documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/)
- [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/)

## Practice
- Write a simple C++ extension for Python using PyBind11.
- Explore ONNX Runtime in C++.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- When would you choose C++ over Python?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the trade-offs of using Rust for ML infrastructure.
