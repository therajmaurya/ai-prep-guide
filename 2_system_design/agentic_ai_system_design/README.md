# Agentic AI System Design

## Core Ideas
- Agent Loops (Observation, Thought, Action).
- Tool use and API integration.
- Memory (Short-term, Long-term).
- Multi-agent orchestration.

## Resources
- [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)
- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

## Practice
- Build a CLI agent that can search the web and summarize results.
- Implement a "Critic" agent that reviews another agent's output.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- How do you prevent an agent from getting into an infinite loop?

### Senior Level
- Discuss security implications of allowing agents to execute code.
