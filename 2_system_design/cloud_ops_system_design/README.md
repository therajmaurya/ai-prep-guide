# Cloud & Ops System Design

## Core Ideas
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Container Orchestration (Kubernetes).
- Serverless vs Provisioned.
- Cost Management.

## Resources
- [Google Cloud Architecture Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework)
- [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)

## Practice
- Deploy a model on Kubernetes with autoscaling.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for an ML application.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is a Spot Instance and when to use it?

### Senior Level
- Design a secure enclave for processing sensitive medical data.
