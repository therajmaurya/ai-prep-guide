# Linear Algebra

## Core Ideas
- Vectors, Matrices, Tensors.
- Matrix Multiplication, Inverse, Determinant.
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Resources
- [Introduction to Linear Algebra (Gilbert Strang)](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/)
- [3Blue1Brown - Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

## Practice
- Implement PCA from scratch.
- Visualize linear transformations.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is rank of a matrix?

### Senior Level
- How does matrix factorization relate to recommender systems?
