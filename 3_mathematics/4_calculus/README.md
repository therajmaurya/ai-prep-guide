# Calculus

## Core Ideas
- Derivatives and Gradients.
- Chain Rule.
- Gradient Descent.
- Convexity.

## Resources
- [Calculus (Stewart)](https://www.stewartcalculus.com/)

## Practice
- Derive the gradient for Mean Squared Error.
- Implement Gradient Descent manually.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is the geometric interpretation of the gradient?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the challenges of optimization in non-convex landscapes.
