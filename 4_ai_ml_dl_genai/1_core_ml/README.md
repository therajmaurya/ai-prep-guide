# Core Machine Learning

## Core Ideas
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning.
- Regression vs Classification.
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs.
- K-Means Clustering.

## Resources
- [Hands-On Machine Learning (Géron)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)

## Practice
- Train a Random Forest on the Titanic dataset.
- Implement K-Means clustering from scratch.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is regularization (L1 vs L2)?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the impact of feature scaling on different algorithms.
