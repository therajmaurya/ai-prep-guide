# Generative AI

## Core Ideas
- Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Diffusion Models.
- GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).
- Prompt Engineering and RAG.

## Resources
- [OpenAI Research](https://openai.com/research)
- [Annotated Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/blog/annotated-diffusion)

## Practice
- Generate images using Stable Diffusion.
- Build a RAG pipeline using LangChain.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is temperature in sampling?

### Senior Level
- Discuss strategies for reducing hallucinations in LLMs.
