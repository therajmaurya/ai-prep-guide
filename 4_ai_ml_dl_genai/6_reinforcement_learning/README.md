# Reinforcement Learning

## Core Ideas
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
- Value-based methods (Q-Learning, DQN).
- Policy-based methods (REINFORCE, PPO).
- Model-based RL.

## Resources
- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton & Barto)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)
- [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/)

## Practice
- Train an agent to play CartPole using DQN.
- Implement Policy Gradient on a simple environment.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is a reward function?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the challenges of offline RL.
