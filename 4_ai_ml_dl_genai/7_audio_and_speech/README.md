# Audio & Speech Processing

## Core Ideas
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP) basics.
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models (Wav2Vec, Whisper).
- Text-to-Speech (TTS).

## Resources
- [Speech and Language Processing (Jurafsky & Martin)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

## Practice
- Build a keyword spotting system.
- Fine-tune Whisper for a specific language.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the architecture of a modern end-to-end ASR system.
