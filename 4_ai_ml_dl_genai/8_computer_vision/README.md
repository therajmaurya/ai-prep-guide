# Computer Vision

## Core Ideas
- Image Classification (ResNet, EfficientNet).
- Object Detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
- Segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN).
- Vision Transformers (ViT).

## Resources
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

## Practice
- Implement a CNN for image classification.
- Fine-tune YOLOv8 on a custom dataset.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is max pooling?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the challenges of training on high-resolution images.
