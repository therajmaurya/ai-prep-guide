# Recommendation Systems

## Core Ideas
- Content-based vs Collaborative Filtering.
- Matrix Factorization (ALS, SVD).
- Deep Learning for RecSys (Two-Tower, DLRM).
- Evaluation Metrics (NDCG, MAP).

## Resources
- [System Design for Recommendations and Search](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Recommendations-Search-e-commerce/dp/1098127791)

## Practice
- Build a movie recommender using Matrix Factorization.
- Implement a session-based recommender using RNNs.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is the cold-start problem?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the trade-offs between diversity and relevance.
