# Chunking Strategies for RAG

## Core Ideas
- Fixed-size vs Semantic Chunking.
- Overlap strategies.
- Document hierarchy preservation.
- Impact on embedding quality.

## Resources
- [LangChain Chunking Strategies](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)

## Practice
- Implement a semantic chunker using BERT embeddings.
- Evaluate retrieval performance with different chunk sizes.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- Why is overlap important in chunking?

### Senior Level
- Design a chunking strategy for a mixed-media document (text + tables).
