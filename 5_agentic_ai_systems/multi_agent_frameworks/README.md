# Multi-Agent Frameworks

## Core Ideas
- Collaborative Agents.
- Role-based delegation.
- Inter-agent communication protocols.
- Human-in-the-loop patterns.

## Resources
- [Microsoft AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
- [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)

## Practice
- Build a software development team (PM, Dev, QA) using AutoGen.
- Simulate a debate between two agents.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- How do agents share state?

### Senior Level
- Discuss the challenges of debugging multi-agent systems.
