# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Core Ideas
- Vector Databases (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate).
- Embedding Models.
- Retrieval Strategies (Top-k, MMR).
- Reranking.

## Resources
- [Pinecone Learning Center](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/)

## Practice
- Build a Q&A bot over your personal notes.
- Implement a RAG pipeline with a reranker.

## Questions
### Mid Level
- What is the context window limit?

### Senior Level
- How to handle "lost in the middle" phenomenon in long contexts?
