# Ilya Sutskever's 30 Papers Reading List

Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI and one of the most influential figures in AI, famously shared a list of ~30 research papers with John Carmack, stating that mastering these would cover "90% of what matters today" in deep learning.

This document contains that curated list, categorized for easier consumption.
