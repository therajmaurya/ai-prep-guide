> **Target Audience**: Senior Software Engineers (10+ years), Tech Leads, and Architects transitioning into or leveling up in AI, Machine Learning, and Generative AI.

This repository is a **structured preparation guide** and **curriculum** designed to help experienced engineers master the full stack of modern AI—from mathematical foundations to large-scale production MLOps and Agentic Systems.

## 🚀 Vision

Unlike generic "data science" roadmaps, this guide focuses on the **engineering and architectural** aspects required for senior roles. It assumes you already know how to code and build systems, and focuses on:
*   **Scale**: How to train and serve models at scale.
*   **Depth**: Going beyond `.fit()` to understand training dynamics and internals.
*   **Production**: MLOps, evaluation, safety, and trade-offs.

## 📚 Curriculum & Study Packs

The repository is organized by topic. Click on a folder to explore the curriculum, resources, and practice exercises for that area.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo

1.  **Select your Level**: Look for tags in topic files (`mid`, `senior`, `principal`) to find relevant depth.
2.  **Follow the Checklists**: Each folder works as a standalone module.
3.  **Practice**: Don't just read. Implement the "Project Ideas" found in the modules.
